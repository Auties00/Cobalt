/**
 * A handler interface for managing error scenarios that occur within the WhatsApp API.
 * <p>
 * This interface enables customizable error handling strategies for different types of failures
 * that can occur during API operations, such as network issues, authentication errors,
 * cryptographic failures, and stream processing problems.
 * <p>
 * The handler determines how the application should respond to these errors through the
 * {@link Result} enum, which supports actions like discarding errors, disconnecting,
 * reconnecting, or logging out completely.
 * <p>
 * Several predefined error handlers are provided through static factory methods that implement
 * common error handling patterns, including logging to the terminal or saving to files.
