/**
 * A serialization interface for managing persistent storage of WhatsApp session data.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a standardized mechanism for serializing and deserializing ({@link WhatsappStore}).
 * <p>
 * The interface supports multiple client types ({@link WhatsappClientType#WEB} and {@link WhatsappClientType#MOBILE})
 * and can be implemented to provide different storage backends. Two built-in implementations are provided:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link WhatsappStoreSerializer#toProtobuf()} - Persists sessions as Protocol Buffer files on disk</li>
 *     <li>{@link WhatsappStoreSerializer#discarding()} - Discards all session data (useful for temporary/ephemeral sessions)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Sessions are identified by either a UUID or a phone number.
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> Implementations should be thread-safe, as serialization operations may be
 * called concurrently from different parts of the WhatsApp API.
