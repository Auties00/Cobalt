/**
 * A runtime exception thrown when a WhatsApp protocol node request does not receive a response
 * within the expected timeout period.
 *
 * <p>This exception occurs during socket communication when a {@link Node} is sent to the WhatsApp
 * server but no response is received within the configured timeout duration (typically 60 seconds).
 * The exception captures the original node that timed out, which can be useful for debugging
 * and error handling purposes.
 *
 * <p>Common scenarios that may trigger this exception include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Network connectivity issues preventing communication with WhatsApp servers</li>
 *   <li>Server-side delays or unavailability</li>
 *   <li>Invalid or malformed requests that the server ignores</li>
 *   <li>Authentication or session problems</li>
 * </ul>
